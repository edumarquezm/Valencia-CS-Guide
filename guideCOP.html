                <h2>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING</h2>
                <p>
                    Computer Programming is the most important aspect of Computer Science, so focusing on these classes is a must. Valencia College offers 4 "major" Computer
                    Programming classes, and they can be taken online or in-person. As a Computer Science major, you must take the following 2 classes: <br /><br />

                    (COP-1000C) <b>Introduction to Programming.</b> This class is taught in the <b>Python</b> programming language, which is a great "first step" for people interested
                    in programming. Make sure to take notes and practice, since having knowledge of Python will be very useful in the long term. Successfull completion of this class will
                    allow you to take the following class: <br /><br />

                    (COP-2220C) <b>C Programming.</b> This class is taught in the <b>C</b> programming language, and this will be the <b>most important class</b> if you are planning to transfer
                    to UCF for their CS program. This class is really important for UCF students since it is the direct pre-requisite for (COP-3502C) Computer Science I, which is also taught in C,
                    and it is considered the most essential class of the whole CS program (as well as the hardest one). <br /><br />

                    (COP-2220C) is simply an "Introduction to C" class, so make sure to take notes and practice a lot to be fully prepared for (COP-3502C) at UCF. <br /><br />

                    *Note: As mentioned before, (COP-2220C) is taught in C, NOT to be confused with C++ or C#, since those are different programming languages.<br /><br /><br />
                    
                    The following 2 programming classes can also be taken at Valencia College; In my opinion, these 2 should be skipped and taken at UCF instead (its only 1 class there). <br /><br />

                    (COP-2800C) <b>Java Programming.</b> This class is taught in the <b>Java</b> programming language, which is considered an "Object Oriented Programming Language", and is very different
                    from the two classes mentioned before. Successful completion of this class will allow you to take: <br /><br />

                    (COP-2805C) <b>Advanced Java Programming.</b> This class is a continuation of COP-2800C. <br /><br />

                    Successful completion of BOTH (COP-2800C) <b>AND</b> (COP-2805C) will count for credit for (COP-3330C) Object Oriented Programming, which is a class required for the CS program at UCF.<br /><br />

                    Once again, I recommend skipping the 2 Java classes at Valencia College, and only taking the necessary class <br />(COP-3330C) at UCF. <br /><br />

                    *Note: As mentioned before, (COP-2800C), (COP-2805C), and (COP-3330C) are taught in Java, NOT to be confused with JavaScript, since that is a different programming language.

                <h2>Some programming advice...</h2>
                <p>
                    Programming might feel hard or confusing at the beginning, so make sure to take some time to study and practice. There are thousands of websites and videos around the internet that will help you to
                    improve your programming skills, so make sure to use them. If you like learning in the "old school" style, I recommend searching for books on Amazon (new) or eBay (used). There are many books that specialize
                    on specific languages (like Python, C, Java, etc.) at very good prices, so don't be afraid to grow your library. <br /><br />

                    Practicing is the key to become a good programmer, try to code your own programs at your own pace; The more you practice, the better your programming skills will get. <br /><br />

                    I highly recommend <b>NOT</b> to abuse tools such as ChatGPT or Copilot, instead, try to use your own notes to solve any problems. AI should only be used to supplement your learning, not to do the work for you,
                    if you let the AI do everything for you, it will become a problem in the long term.

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p>
                    The following are some common questions that I have personally heard, or seen on places like Reddit and Discord. <br /><br />

                    <b>How long does it take to get a Computer Science degree? </b> <br /><br />

                    Both UCF and UF's websites claim "4-5 years," which is a very good estimate. Assuming you take 4 or 5 classes each semester, pass all of them, and don't skip any
                    semester, you should be done in 4 years. Most people take 5 years while taking 3 classes each semester. <br /><br />

                    On the other hand, skipping semesters and failing classes will take longer. There are too many classes with pre-requisites in the major, so failing some classes such as
                    Calculus I or Introduction to C will definitely make the degree take longer. <br /><br />

                    <b>Is Computer Science an easy degree?</b><br /><br />

                    It is NOT an easy degree, but at the same time, it is not the hardest degree out there. A Computer Science degree contains many difficult Math and Computer Logic classes that could be hard for some people,
                    as well as some hard required electives (such as Physics I and II). <br /><br />

                    <b>Is Computer Science easier or harder than Engineering?</b><br /><br />

                    It depends on the person; some people are better with Physics and some people are better with Computer Logic. In my opinion, degrees like Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering are
                    MUCH HARDER than a Computer Science degree. <br /><br />

                    <b>Should I take summer classes?</b><br /><br />

                    Yes, you should. There is a lot of classes required for a CS degrees, so skipping the summer semester is not a good idea, at least during your time at Valencia College. If you are looking to take classes in the summer,
                    try to look towards the general electives classes, such as humanities, social sciences or communications, since those are always available ONLINE during the summer. <br /><br />

                    If you don't want to take summer classes, that's completely fine, since taking a break from classes might be good for you. More importantly, do not forget to register for the Fall term (many students forget after taking a summer break).<br /><br />

                    <b>I would like to transfer to UCF, which high-level Math electives should I take?</b><br /><br />

                    As seen on the top right of the <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CS-2023-2024-Course-Flowchart.pdf">UCF Computer Science Flowchart</a>, there are four highlighted options: (MAC-2313) Calculus III, (MAP-2302) Differential Equations,
                    (MAS-3105) Matrix and Linear Algebra, (MAS-3106) Linear Algebra. As well as other options such as "any 4000-5000 Math/Stat Course with STA, MAA, MAD, or MAS prefixes." <br /><br />

                    As a reminder, Calculus III and Differential Equations are offered at Valencia College and UCF, while all the other options are only offered at UCF. <br /><br />

                    Most people recommend taking both Linear Algebra classes since they are very useful for Computer Science, but at the same time, they warn about its difficulty. Other people recommend taking Calculus III and Differential Equations at Valencia College to be done
                    with those requirements before transferring to UCF. <br /><br />

                    In my opinion, do some research about which class is more useful for your specific interest (for example, Linear Algebra is very useful for Machine Learning), and make a decision based upon that. <br /><br />

                    <b>Can I take College Physics instead of Physics with Calculus to satisfy the Physics requirement?</b><br /><br />

                    Unfortunately, <b>no.</b> The Physics classes required for Computer Science majors at both UCF and UF are Physics with Calculus I and II. <br /><br />
